        <h2>The Drive</h2>
        <p>
            "Eight hours is what we expected the drive to be, but it took us 10 hours instead. We got to drive through Nashville and as a Colts fan I made sure to boo the Titans while driving past thier stadium. We lost a lot of time from the drive because of a wreck that took us an hour to go a couple miles. The gps also took us down very narrow roads in the mountains while it was dark making that part of the trip some white knuckle driving.
